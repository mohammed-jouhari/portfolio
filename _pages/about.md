I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Faculty of Sciences, Ibn Tofail University (Kenitra, Morocco). My work lies at the intersection of **cybersecurity, IoT/IIoT systems, federated learning, UAV-enabled communications, and mobile edge intelligence for 6G**. I am particularly interested in building **lightweight, explainable, and energy-efficient intrusion detection systems** for resource-constrained environments.

### Research Interests
- Intrusion detection in IoT/IIoT networks  
- Federated and distributed learning for edge devices  
- UAV-assisted networking and sensing systems  
- Mobile edge intelligence for 6G  
- Explainable AI for network security  

### Academic Background
- **PhD in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Applications** (2019, Ibn Tofail University, Kenitra)  
  Dissertation: *Advances in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks* — Highest honors with congratulations of the jury.  
- **Postdoctoral research** at UM6P (Morocco) and Qatar University, focusing on ML-driven IoT security and UAV-based intelligent surveillance.  

### Editorial & Scientific Service
- **Editorial Board Member**: *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Springer Nature, since 2025)  
- **Reviewer**: 55+ reviews for leading journals, including *IEEE Internet of Things Journal*, *IEEE Access*, *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology*, and *Sensors*.  
- **TPC Member**: IEEE Globecom, ICC, IWCMC, WINCOM, and other international conferences (2021–2025).  
- **Chair**: Workshop on AI-Driven Network Security & Anomaly Detection (EngiTek 2025).  

### Teaching & Mentorship
I teach courses in cybersecurity, distributed systems, cloud computing, and digital culture, and I supervise Master’s and PhD students. My teaching approach emphasizes **hands-on labs, reproducibility, and open science practices**.

### Selected Publications
